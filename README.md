# Financial-Risk-Forecast-Time-Series
Apply the Value At Risk model to forecast the lower 15% quantile 10 steps ahead for 40 different stocks. I am only showing the forecasts for the first and last data sets. 
After importing the data we see that this is the time series.

We plot stock 1:

We plot stock 40:

We use performance analytics to find forecast (lower) 15% quantiles 10 steps ahead for each series (in other words, forecasts for Value-at-Risk).
We plot the 1st and the 40th Value at Risk for the lower 15% quantile for 10 steps ahead. 
The plot for stock 1 is as follows:
